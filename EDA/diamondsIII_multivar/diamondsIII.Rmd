## Introduction

This last analysis will be going in depth into a analysis model to try and understand the features for pricing and allow us to come up with a model. It's fun.

### Histograms by Facet and Color

```{r Histogram byFC, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(price)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = cut), binwidth = 100) +
  facet_wrap(~color, ncol = 3) +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = 'qual') +
  coord_trans(x = 'log10')
```
